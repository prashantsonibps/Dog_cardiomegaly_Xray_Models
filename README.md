# Dog Cardiomegaly Detection

This project focuses on detecting Dog Cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) from X-ray images using Deep Learning techniques. 

### Highlight: 85.75% Accuracy on Validation App! 🎉

## Approach

I initially started experimenting with **ResNet**, extracting features and evaluating different architectures to classify the images correctly. After initial trials, I switched to **EfficientNet-B7**, which performed exceptionally well and ultimately achieved an accuracy of **85.75%** on the validation application. 

The notebooks included in this repository showcase the entire workflow:
- Data loading, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
- Feature extraction and model building using ResNet and EfficientNet-B7.
- Training and evaluating the performance of the models.
- Saving predictions for final evaluation.

## Files Included

- `Project_one_prashant_Soni.ipynb` & `Week9_Prashant_Soni.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebooks containing the code for model training, feature extraction, and evaluation.
- Various prediction CSV files and evaluation graphs/screenshots showing the model's loss and validation results.
